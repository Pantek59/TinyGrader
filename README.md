# About the Project
This project aims to provider a simple way to grade the performance of a class with the ability to separate the grading scheme from the list of students. This gives you the opportunity to use the same grading scheme for different classes with different group structures without additional effort.

For the grading scheme [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) is used while the student list has to be provided in a CSV-file. Consequently, the files can be created and edited using any plain text editor you prefer.

# Built with
The grading tool has been written in Javascript and HTML using the frameworks [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

# Getting Started
There is no installation process. Copy all the files to a folder on a disk drive or web space and open the file ```grader.html``` in a web browser and select which grading scheme and student list to use
